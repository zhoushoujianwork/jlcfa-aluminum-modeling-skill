## Materials

- Shell body: 6063-T5 aluminum alloy. Unspecified dimensional tolerance for material follows GB/T 5237.1-2017 high precision.
- Cover plate: 5052 aluminum alloy.
- Cover thickness options: 1.5 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm.

## Cutouts And Holes

- Laser minimum opening: 0.5 mm.
- Supported threaded holes: M2, M2.5, M3, M4.
- If opening height is under 30 mm, reserve at least 2 mm rib.
- If opening height is over 30 mm and under 70 mm, reserve at least 3 mm rib.
- Keep hole-to-edge distance over 3 mm.
- Avoid laser cutting/drilling at stiffening ribs, threaded-hole areas, or wall thickness over 4 mm.
- System-library openings are already expanded by 0.2 mm clearance over the physical measured size.

| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Tolerance | +/-0.20 | +/-0.50 | +/-1.00 | +/-2.00 |

Angle dimensions, grade m:

## Appearance Levels

- General: slight color difference is allowed; profile texture is allowed up to 5 places; slight scratches within 10 mm are allowed up to 5 places; no more than five spots up to 2 mm are allowed.
- Strict, priced +10%: no visible color difference, except possible batch color difference; spots up to 1 mm are allowed up to 2 places; slight scratches up to 5 mm are allowed up to 2 places.
- Extreme, priced +30%: no visible color difference, except possible slight batch color difference; no visible spots or scratches.

## Sandblast Anodizing

- Standard products only provide natural and black; other colors should be selected in the designer.
- Optional colors shown by JLCFA: natural, black, sky blue, champagne, red, lake blue, rose pink, emerald green, deep space gray.
- Sandblast medium: corundum, 100 mesh.
- Process note: sandblast first, then anodize, to maintain insulation.

Anodized film thickness:

| Color | Thickness |
| --- | ---: |
| Natural | 3.8-5.7 um |
| Black | 1.6-2.4 um |
| Sky blue | 1.4-2.0 um |
| Champagne | 1.2-1.8 um |
| Red | 0.9-1.5 um |
| Lake blue | 4.5-8.0 um |
| Rose pink | 1.0-2.0 um |
| Emerald green | 1.3-2.6 um |
| Deep space gray | 0.8-1.9 um |

## Marking And Printing

Laser marking:

- Depth: 3-5 um.
- Minimum character: 0.2 mm.
- Minimum line width: 0.012 mm.
- Laser marking supports single color.
- For black lettering, shown body colors include natural, deep space gray, and champagne.
- For white lettering, shown body colors include black, lake blue, rose pink, red, emerald green, and sky blue.
- SVG vector upload is recommended.
- Keep disconnected/negative-space gaps over 3 px to avoid sticking together.
- For high-quality graphics, recommend UV printing.
- Font preview recommends No. 4 font. Supported displayed font sizes: 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0.
- Do not upload unverified certification/standard marks or claims, including national standard numbers, environmental/certification logos such as RoHS, CE, 3C, UL, certification-related graphics, or text implying compliance such as ISO9001/RoHS certification. JLCFA may reject production or delete violating marks.

UV printing:

- JLCFA presents UV printing as replacing silkscreen for better vividness, durability, fade resistance, and appearance.
- Font color can be arbitrary; graphic shape can be arbitrary.
- Print height must be under 100 mm.
- Prefer printing on flat surfaces.
- UV supports multicolor output; laser marking is single-color.

## Machining Process Selection

Cover machining:

- Full laser cutting: relatively rough surface, laser-cut texture, no micro-tabs on internal holes, micro-tabs on outer contour.
- Laser cutting plus CNC: internal structures use laser cutting; outer contour and countersinks use CNC; smoother outer contour, no laser cutting texture, no micro-tabs.
- Full CNC: smooth surface, no laser cutting texture, no micro-tabs.
- If the design has steps, counterbore/countersink holes, or blind holes, choose CNC.
- If a hole is a sharp right angle, default machining uses R0.5.
- If cover thickness is over 2 mm, JLCFA recommends laser cutting plus CNC. Cover thickness choices remain 1.5, 2, and 3 mm.

Body machining:

- Full laser cutting: relatively rough surface, laser-cut texture, micro-tabs.
- Full CNC: smooth surface, no laser cutting texture, no micro-tabs.
- If the design has steps, counterbore/countersink holes, or blind holes, choose CNC.
- If a hole is a sharp right angle, default machining uses R0.5.

## Attribute Construction Tips

- Use `process: "laser_cut"` only for simple through cutouts that satisfy minimum width, rib, edge, and thickness constraints.
- Use `process: "cnc"` for blind holes, counterbores/countersinks, steps, sharp internal-corner expectations, wall thickness over 4 mm, or features near ribs/threaded regions.
- Use `feature.type: "standard_opening"` for library cutouts and keep the 0.2 mm default clearance in mind.
- Use `feature.type: "custom_opening"` for user dimensions, and explicitly record checked constraints in `constraintsChecked`.
- For marking, separate `laser_mark` and `uv_print`; record whether the artwork is `svg`, `image`, or `text`, and whether the selected color/process is single- or multi-color.
- When the profile/model number is unknown, do not invent it. Set `profileId: "unknown"` and ask the user to pick a JLCFA shell model.
