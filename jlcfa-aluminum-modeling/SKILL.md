# JLCFA Aluminum Modeling

Use this skill to turn enclosure requirements into structured modeling attributes and to check them against JLCFA aluminum alloy enclosure process limits.

## Usage Preview

![BBClaw aluminum enclosure design preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhoushoujianwork/jlcfa-aluminum-modeling-skill/main/jlcfa-aluminum-modeling/assets/bbclaw-usage-preview.png)

Example output from a BBClaw enclosure request: the skill reads a 3MF shell reference, turns the request into JLCFA-oriented design notes, structured JSON attributes, and a front-panel SVG preview.

## Source Rules

Before giving manufacturability advice, detailed dimensions, tolerances, materials, finishes, marking, or machining-process choices, read [references/jlcfa-standards.md](references/jlcfa-standards.md).

Treat the reference as a design aid transcribed from JLCFA public pages. For order-critical or high-cost production decisions, tell the user to verify the current values on the linked JLCFA pages.

## Workflow

1. Parse the user's enclosure intent into: base shell/profile, cover plates, faces, openings, screw/countersink holes, text/graphics, finish, machining process, tolerances, and export needs.
2. Keep dimensions in millimeters. State the coordinate frame you assume for each face, such as `front-panel origin at lower-left, +X right, +Y up`.
3. Prefer explicit, machine-readable attributes. If the user only gives natural language, infer conservative defaults and mark every assumption.
4. Check every feature against the JLCFA constraints in the reference: minimum cut width, opening-to-edge distance, rib reservations, available threaded holes, cover thickness, process choices, finish colors, and marking rules.
5. When a feature conflicts with constraints, propose the smallest practical adjustment and explain which rule drove it.
6. End with a compact "属性清单" plus a "待确认" list for missing dimensions, shell model/profile, quantity, color, surface quality, and production-critical tolerances.

## Attribute Shape

Use this shape unless the target CAD/tool has its own schema:

```json

  },

}
```

## Output Style

Use Chinese when the user writes Chinese. Keep the final result practical: a short explanation, a JSON-like attribute block, conflicts/fixes, and open questions. Do not claim that JLCFA will accept a model unless the current order page or an engineer has confirmed it.
